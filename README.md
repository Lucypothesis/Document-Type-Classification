# Document-Type-Classification

Developed a classification model for 17 document types, addressing the challenge of distinguishing visually similar types of documents.    
Enhanced ViT model performance using techniques including data augmentation, transfer learning, and test-time preprocessing.   
   
Role: Data preprocessing and augmentation, model selection and enhancement   
Results: Improved macro F1(0.8030 -> 0.9465)
